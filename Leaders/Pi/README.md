These files are run on a raspberry pi connected over serial to a leader SPIKE Prime to control start and stop. The same files can be used for both leaders.

Use audioManual.py to manually send start/stop values to the SPIKE

Use audiothresh.py to visualize and threshold microphone data and then audio.py to send start/stop values to SPIKE based on microphone readings and threshold.
